I saw the other day that [Github's Electron](http://electron.atom.io) had made it to v1.0 - I was seriously surprised I hadn't heard about Electron already, seeing as I use Atom, Github's open sourced text editor built with Electron, every day. In a nutshell Electron is essentially a nice way to build native feeling apps using web technologies. 

Here's the elevator pitch for Electron:

> Electron is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

I think it looks like it might be the tool that finally gets me into Mac (plus Windows & Linux as bonus) development. I have a couple of ideas that I think could be fun to build! 

Looks like it's finally time for me to learn the new JavaScript hotness... Is it [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) at the moment? ???? I feel like I only just began learning Angular...
