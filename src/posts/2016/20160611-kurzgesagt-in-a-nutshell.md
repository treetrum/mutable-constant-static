So, I found a pretty damn good YouTube channel. They're called Kurzgesagt, or simply 'In A Nutshell', if you can't be bothered trying to work out how to pronounce that, they explain _things_ In a Nutshell. Lot's of sciencey stuff, lots of philosophy, **all** really interesting content. 

Therefore, I've been on a bit of a binge with this channel lately. So, they had better hurry up and make some new content, I'm running out! Seriously... Content. Now. 

Here's one of the standouts, if you enjoy it, you should check them out because they've got quite the backlog. If you _really_ enjoy it, you should back them on [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/Kurzgesagt).
