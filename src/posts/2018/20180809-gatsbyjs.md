So, you might be noticing that this site is looking pretty swanky right about now. Just kidding, no one reads this ಠ_ಠ. Nevertheless, the site has been completely rebuilt, and that's what this article is about.

Unlike my blog rebuild you *probably* have noticed of this new framework taking JS by storm: [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). It's pretty great. In case you haven't, here's the short summary: it's a static site generator, powered by [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org).

It's a stupidly simple way to get a react based site up and running that includes server side rendering and static generation out of the box. On top of that, because it's built on GraphQL, you can finally have the motivation to learn *yet another* JS framework.

I'd been thinking about moving this site away from WordPress for a while now. Although WordPress is a platform I am deeply familiar with - I felt it was time for me to learn something completely different. Gatsby seemed like the obvious choice at the time of development. For something as simple as my little dev blog, it was more than powerful enough - plus it came with none of the heft and pain of dealing with a WordPress install. As an added bonus, I can now host it for free with one of the free tiers offered by hosts such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Now](https://zeit.co/now) or even just [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). I chose Netlify.

You should give it a shot, I have a feeling you won't be dissapointed - I was very pleasantly suprised!
